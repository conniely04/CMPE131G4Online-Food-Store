        "OFS" (Online Food Store) aims to establish an online platform to
        conveniently allow customers to purchase organic grocery items through a
        digital payment process. OFS aims to serve customers located within
        delivery distance around downtown San Jose. Customers should have a
        pleasant shopping experience where they can see what grocery items are
        available, add them to a virtual cart, have a secure payment process,
        and receive their groceries delivered to their home.
